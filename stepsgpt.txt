Step 1: Setting Up the Project

Create a new directory for your project: mkdir ticket-show-app
Navigate into the project directory: cd ticket-show-app
Step 2: Backend Setup with Flask

Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
On Windows (Command Prompt): venv\Scripts\activate.bat
On Windows (PowerShell): venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Install Flask and other required packages: pip install Flask Flask-Security Flask-CORS Flask-RESTful
Create a backend directory inside your project directory.
Step 3: Frontend Setup with Vue.js

Install Vue CLI globally: npm install -g @vue/cli
Create a Vue.js project: vue create frontend
Configure Vue CLI to use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting.
Step 4: Database Setup with SQLite

Create a database directory inside your project directory.
Step 5: Caching Setup with Redis

Install and set up Redis on your local system.
Install the redis Python package: pip install redis
Step 6: Celery Setup for Batch Jobs

Install the celery Python package: pip install celery
Create a tasks directory inside your backend directory.
Configure Celery to use Redis as the broker and backend for task results.
Step 7: App Structure

Your project directory structure should look something like this:

arduino
Copy code

│
├── backend/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── models.py
│   │   ├── routes.py
│   │   ├── tasks.py
│   │   ├── security.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── config.py
│   └── run.py

├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── views/
│   │   ├── App.vue
│   │   └── main.js
│   └── ...
│
├── database/
│   ├── migrations/
│   └── ticket_show.db
│
└── venv/
Step 8: Implementing Features

Follow the Flask and Vue.js documentation to create routes, components, and views for each feature.
Implement user authentication and RBAC using Flask-Security and JWT.
Implement CRUD operations for theatres and shows using Flask-RESTful.
Set up Celery tasks for background processing, such as sending reminders and generating reports.
Implement search functionality using Vue.js and API calls.
Create Vue.js components for booking show tickets and handling user interactions.
Set up caching using Redis for performance optimization.
Implement scheduled jobs for daily reminders and monthly reports using Celery.
Design and style your UI using Vue.js and CSS, adhering to the provided design guidelines.
Implement predictive analytics for show/venue popularity based on historical data.
Step 9: Testing and Deployment

Test your application thoroughly on your local system.
Set up deployment on a web server, such as Gunicorn for Flask and a web server for Vue.js.
Deploy your backend and frontend to a hosting platform of your choice.
Remember that this is a high-level guide, and you'll need to dive into each step in more detail to fully implement your ticket show app. Use the provided guidelines, documentation of Flask, Vue.js, Redis, and Celery, and other relevant resources to build and refine your application. Good luck!
